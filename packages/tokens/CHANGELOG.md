### Patch Changes

- [#45](https://github.com/manti-ui/ui/pull/45) [`c41eb8a`](https://github.com/manti-ui/ui/commit/c41eb8a6d912a6215d6a2e270dcfdae07ba95578) Thanks [@tutkuofnight](https://github.com/tutkuofnight)! - **Splitter** — rework the resize handle so it grows visually without reflowing
  the panels: the trigger is now a fixed-width grab track holding a thin line
  (drawn with `::before`) that tones and widens via an outline on hover/drag,
  instead of animating the track's own width. The widen/tone is keyed on
  `:hover`/`[data-dragging]` (not `[data-focus]`) so the handle no longer stays
  stuck in the active tone after a mouse drag ends. Adds three component tokens —
  `--manti-splitter-handle-size`, `--manti-splitter-line-size`, and
  `--manti-splitter-line-size-active`.
